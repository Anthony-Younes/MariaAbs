        <h1>For You, Maria Abs Younes</h1>
        <p>I made this because I couldn’t think of another way to say it. I miss you, and I believe you will be my wife.</p>

                I see a vision, a vision where we are sipping wine,  
                Through the corridors, the corridors of life,  
                Where our souls entwine.
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh, my dear, my dear, I can't believe  
                That I can call you mine.  
                Through the depths, the depths of life,  
                I’d rather no one but you by my side.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through the highs, the highs of love,  
                I want you, no one but you,  
                If I could, my love,  
                I'd put you in my hide.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet I don’t understand; you question my will to fight.  
                Baby, I assure you,  
                You are the only one in my sight.
            </p>
            <p>
                My lady, we were made for each other.  
                Side by side, we will make it through this night.
            </p>
